# Data Science Case Study: Flight Prediction Model

![Flight Prediction Model](flight-prediction-model.jpg)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Data_Science_case_Study_Flight_Prediction_Model" project! The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven solution to predict flight prices accurately. By analyzing historical flight data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a machine learning model, we aim to help customers like Ahmed make informed decisions and find the optimal time to purchase flight tickets.

## Dataset

The project utilizes two separate datasets: "sastaticket_test.csv" and "sastaticket_train.csv". These datasets contain relevant information about flight prices, routes, departure and arrival times, airlines, and more. By combining these datasets, we create a final dataset named "prediction result with trantestsplit.csv" for model training and evaluation.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the flight data.
2. Identify the cheapest and most expensive flights at specific times to assist customers like Ahmed in making cost-effective decisions.
3. Develop a machine learning model to predict future flight prices accurately.
4. Find the optimal time or "sweet spot" for purchasing cheap tickets based on the model predictions.

## Instructions

1. Start by exploring and understanding the dataset provided.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the flight data.
3. Preprocess and clean the data as necessary, handling missing values and outliers.
4. Perform feature engineering, if applicable, to extract meaningful insights and improve model performance.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
6. Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm and train the model using the training data.
7. Fine-tune the model hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
8. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and assess its accuracy in predicting flight prices.
9. Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.
10. Generate insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions, such as identifying the optimal time to purchase flight tickets.
